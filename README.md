# 🎬 CineBook — Movie Booking System

A full-stack movie ticket booking system built with **Spring Boot** (backend) and **React + Vite** (frontend), featuring:

- ✅ **Optimistic Locking** to handle concurrent seat booking conflicts
- ✅ **MySQL** persistent database
- ✅ **JWT Authentication** delivered via secure HttpOnly cookies, with role-based access (USER / ADMIN)
- ✅ **Instant booking confirmation** — no external payment gateway, seats are booked in a single atomic step
- ✅ **Real-time seat layout** with seat type support (Standard / Premium / Recliner)
- ✅ **Admin Dashboard** to manage movies, shows, and theaters

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

| Tool       | Version  |
|------------|----------|
| Java       | 17+      |
| Maven      | 3.8+     |
| MySQL      | 8.0+     |
| Node.js    | 18+      |
| npm        | 9+       |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Create the MySQL database

**Option B — Local MySQL install:**
```sql
CREATE DATABASE moviedb;
```

The app will auto-create tables on startup (`spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update`), so you only need the empty schema to exist.

> The connection string also has `createDatabaseIfNotExist=true`, so MySQL will create it for you automatically if it doesn't already exist — as long as your user has `CREATE` privileges.

### 2. Configure database credentials

Edit `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties`:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/moviedb?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true&useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root
```

Change `username` / `password` to match your local MySQL setup.

### 3. Run the Backend

```bash
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The backend starts on **http://localhost:8081**

On first run, sample movies/theaters/shows/users are seeded automatically. On subsequent restarts, the seeder detects existing data and skips re-seeding (so your bookings persist).

### 4. Run the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend starts on **http://localhost:3000**

## 🔐 Concurrent Booking — Optimistic Locking Explained

The `Seat` entity uses JPA's `@Version` annotation:

```java
@Entity
public class Seat {
    @Version
    private Long version;  // Auto-incremented on every update
}
```

**What happens when two users try to book the same seat simultaneously:**

1. User A and User B both fetch seat with `version = 0`
2. User A's request is processed first → seat saved with `version = 1` and `status = BOOKED` ✅
3. User B's request then tries to save the same seat → Hibernate detects the `version` mismatch → throws `ObjectOptimisticLockingFailureException` ❌
4. The global exception handler catches this and returns HTTP 409 Conflict:
   ```json
   { "message": "One or more seats were just booked by another user. Please refresh and try again." }
   ```

No database-level row locks needed — this approach is fast and scales well under load.

---

## 🎟️ Booking Flow

```
User selects seats
       ↓
POST /api/bookings
  → Validates seats are AVAILABLE
  → Locks seats via optimistic version check (status → BOOKED)
  → If a conflict occurs (seat taken concurrently) → 409 Conflict
  → Otherwise → Booking is created with status CONFIRMED
       ↓
Booking confirmation page shown immediately
```

There is no external payment step — bookings are confirmed the moment seats are successfully reserved. This keeps the focus on the concurrency-safety mechanics; a payment gateway can be reintroduced later as a separate step between seat-locking and confirmation if needed.

## 🔑 Authentication

The JWT is delivered as an `HttpOnly` cookie named `jwt` on login — the browser sends it automatically with every request to the API (`withCredentials: true` is set on the frontend's Axios instance). There's no `Authorization` header to manage manually.
